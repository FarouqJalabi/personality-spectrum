        Communication patterns are like dances that can spiral into negativity if not carefully managed. Recognize how certain words or behaviors trigger unhealthy cycles between you and your partner. For example, criticism may lead to defensiveness, stonewalling, or even contempt. Address these patterns by shifting towards more constructive styles, like assertiveness, which fosters respect and clarity.

        3. Shift the Focus to Experiences Over Facts

    <p>
        When conflicts arise, avoid getting bogged down by the 'facts' of past events, which often leads to disputes over accuracy rather than resolution. Instead, focus on how these events felt and the impact they had on each person. This approach prioritizes emotional understanding over factual accuracy, facilitating deeper empathy and connection.

        4. Cultivate a 'We' Attitude
    </p>
    <p>
        Embrace a collaborative mindset by adopting a 'we' attitude. This means approaching problems together, seeking solutions, and finding common ground. By using inclusive language and focusing on shared goals, you create an environment of partnership and mutual support.
